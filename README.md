## üìö Abstract

We introduce an unsupervised learning model inspired by the structure of episodic memory. The model exploits temporal co-occurrence across modalities to learn persistent cross-modal representations without supervision or hard-coded alignment.  
Results show emergent association abilities between visual and semantic stimuli, suggesting possible implications for cognitive AI and biologically-inspired memory systems.
